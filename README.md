Machine Learning with Python (IBM AI Engineering) 

For the final project, we are asked to utilize all the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate the testing data using evaluation metrics learned in the course.

Algorithms used are:

Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM

Models used for evaluation:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
