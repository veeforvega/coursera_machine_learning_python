# Machine Learning with Python (IBM AI Engineering) 

For the final project, I used a rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology to build a classifier to predict whether there will be rain the following day. I cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithms to the data.

Algorithms used are:

1. Linear Regression
2. KNN
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. SVM

Evaluated model above using:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score
 
The models were used to generate a report at the end.
